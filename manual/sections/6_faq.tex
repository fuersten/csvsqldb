Problem: Not able to use expressions in aggregations

\begin{SQL}
select name,avg(cast(system as int)) from system_tables group by name order by name
\end{SQL}

Results in the error

\begin{Bash}
ERROR: currently only identifier allowed as aggregation parameter
\end{Bash}

Workaround: Use a sub select

\begin{SQL}
select name,avg(sys) from (select name,cast(system as int) as sys from system_tables) group by name order by name
\end{SQL}
