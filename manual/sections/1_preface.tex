This book was produced with \LaTeX{} and uses quite a few additional packages for its formatting. Just to name a few:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source code formatting was done with the help of the listings package
\item Captions where styled with the caption package
\item Boxes where styled with the tcolorbox package
\item Headers where styled with the fancyhdr package
\end{itemize}

\section*{Acknowledgements}

\cleardoublepage % Forces the first chapter to start on an odd page so it's on the right
